# FPGA Trading Accelerator  
*Hardware-accelerated low-latency trading infrastructure*  

## Overview  
Open-source Verilog/VHDL components for building FPGA-based trading systems. Implements market data parsing, order book management, and strategy execution with sub-microsecond latency. Designed for Xilinx/Intel FPGAs with PCIe and 10G/100G Ethernet support.  

## Key Features  
### 1. Market Data Processing  
- **Protocol Decoders**: Hardware parsers for FIX/ITCH/OUCH protocols.  
- **Tick-to-Order Book**: Real-time aggregation of price/volume data.  

### 2. Order Management  
- **Order State Machine**: Cancel/replace logic with 16ns latency (simulated).  
- **Risk Controls**: Pre-trade checks (e.g., position limits) in hardware.  

### 3. Strategy Templates  
- **Arbitrage**: Cross-exchange latency optimizations.  
- **TWAP/VWAP**: Time-weighted execution with RTL reference designs.

## Getting Started  
### Simulation (No Hardware Needed)  
1. Install Icarus Verilog:  
   ```bash  
   sudo apt install iverilog gtkwave  

2. Run testbench:
    ```bash
    cd sim/itch_parser && make simulate

3. Synthesis(Incase of a Physical FPGA):
    ```bash
    vivado -mode batch -source scripts/synth_zynq.tcl  

### Contributing
1. Report Issues: Use GitHub Issues for bugs/feature requests.
2. Development Flow:
    * Branch naming: feat/itch-parser or fix/orderbook-bug.
    * PRs require:
        * Passing testbench simulations.
        * Synthesis reports for target FPGAs.
